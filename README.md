# Multiple-linear-regression

## Mutiple linear regression
Multiple Linear Regression is one of the important regression algorithms which models the linear relationship between a single dependent continuous variable and more than one independent variable.
## Some key points about MLR:
o	For MLR, the dependent or target variable(Y) must be the continuous/real, but the predictor or independent variable may be of continuous or categorical form.                          
o	Each feature variable must model the linear relationship with the dependent variable.                           
o	MLR tries to fit a regression line through a multidimensional space of data-points.                         
## Assumptions for Multiple Linear Regression:                                         
o	A linear relationship should exist between the Target and predictor variables.                     
o	The regression residuals must be normally distributed.                       
o	MLR assumes little or no multicollinearity (correlation between the independent variable) in data.
